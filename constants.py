'''Chemical constants

This module contains all of the chemical constants used by Deuterater, these
are not subject to change, and therefore are not specified in the resources
folder

All masses are given in unified atomic mass units (u) a.k.a. Daltons (Da)

All masses are monoisotopic from NIST

Elemental distributions can be found : TODO
Amino acid information can be found : TODO

Settings and filters found at : TODO

TODO: Discuss which constants are necessary here and validate that the
correct values are given

Attributes
----------
NEUTRON : int
    Mass of a neutron
PROTON : int
    Mass of a proton

'''

NEUTRON = 1.008664916
PROTON = 1.007276467
