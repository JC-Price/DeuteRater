### CHANGES/ADDITIONS ###
- include a peptide n-value calculation option along with v6 (talk to Ariel)
    - setting for retention time (30 sec), charge state range, and delta mass.
    - average together retention times if they fall in window
- standardize DR setting capitalization and update ReadMe

### TESTING AND PACKAGING ###
- update ReadMe...
    - can't upload a settings file you used in another folder (unless you change paths) DONE
    - add warning about keeping DR open for consecutive runs DONE
    - update columns and explanations for each step/file
    - make sure all screenshots match current version
        - a lot of the error message screenshots say DeuteRater-H etc.
    - add note about using different retention times for each mzML and add details about Time and Enrichment Table
    - include note that we aren't checking for peptides with extremely similar mz and rt
- update license in each module
- package and publish on GitHub

### NEXT STEPS ###
- rename steps to be more descriptive?
- add batch capability/setting to run multiple ID files (aka. one ID per mzML)
- reorganize Settings_Menu.ui
- figure out how to integrate fractional n-values
- fix issue where names are cut off in graph titles
- add Ion Mobility


- n values, essential vs non-essential amino acid n-values and how they change with conditions (diets - high/low protein)
