### TESTING AND PACKAGING ###
- check column names for sequence and make them generic
- update ReadMe...
    - can't upload a settings file you used in another folder (unless you change paths) DONE
    - add warning about keeping DR open for consecutive runs DONE
    - update columns and explanations for each step/file
    - make sure all screenshots match current version
        - a lot of the error message screenshots say DeuteRater-H etc.
    - add note about using different retention times for each mzML and add details about Time and Enrichment Table
    - include note that we aren't checking for peptides with extremely similar mz and rt
    - add note about calculating lipid rate curve asymptote
    - median first derivative and n-value standard deviation settings
- update license in each module
- package and publish on GitHub

### NEXT STEPS ###
- standardize DR setting capitalization and update ReadMe
- Upgrade environment/library with updated packages (especially pymzml)
- Double check that available core recognition/throttling is working.
- memory issue with extraction. Running DeuteRater again might fail.
    - Coleman extracts and then will crash during fraction new.
- CPU not being limited in some machines.
- rename DeuteRater steps to be more descriptive?
- add batch capability/setting to run multiple ID files (aka. one ID per mzML) - ask Coleman
- reorganize Settings_Menu.ui (maybe alphabetical, or group related settings for each step together)
- fix issue where names are cut off in graph titles
- add Ion Mobility
